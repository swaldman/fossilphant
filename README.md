### a static-site generator for mastodon archives

fossilphant generates static websites from
archives of your posts [you can export](https://allthings.how/how-to-export-and-import-your-data-on-mastodon/)
from a Mastodon instance.

If your instance is shutting down, you can move to a new server,
but your posts as a member of the departing instance will be effectively
deleted from the internet.

To keep your posts alive...

1. download an archive of your posts
2. use `fossilphant` to generate simple, static website
   from the archive
3. rehost the site via any platform or service that hosts simple websites

## Examples

You can see examples in the two themes currently defined,
[`shatter`](https://www.mchange.com/projects/fossilphant/example/shatter)
and [`tower`](https://www.mchange.com/projects/fossilphant/example/tower).

## Prerequisites

You will need a [Java virtual machine](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html),
version 17 or higher, installed on your machine, and a UNIXy command line.

## Quick Start

1. Download your archive file from your Mastodon instance
2. Clone or download this distribution
3. From the root directory of this distribution, run
   ```plaintext
   $ ./fossilphant-site-gen /path/to/my-maston-archive
   ```
   The archive can be an already extracted directory, or the orignal
    `.tar.gz` file. (The application will extract it into a
   temporary directory if necessary.)

That's it!

You should see a directory called `public`
that contains your new website.

## Customization

`fossilphant` is configurable, and for the truly ambitious,
themable.

Edit the file [`src/config.scala`](src/config.scala) to customize.
Configuration is documented in the comments of that file.

> [!NOTE]  
> _Posts that were sent followers-only or that are marked sensitive
> will not be published by default. Edit `config.scala` if you want
> those posts published._
> 
> _(Posts directed neither to the general public
> nor to followers will not be published. No setting overrides that.
> Although of course a bug might.)_

You can mess around with colors, direct self links to your new identity,
redirect tag links to a new host so they don't break against a defunct instance,
change the title, the tagline, or the whole theme.

## Development

`fossilphant` is built in Scala, on top of my own template (well,
[`untemplate`](https://github.com/swaldman/untemplate-doc#readme)) library,
and my static-site-generator generator [`unstatic`](https://github.com/swaldman/unstatic).

If you are a front-end developer, the
[templates that define themes](fossilphant/untemplate/com/mchange/fossilphant/theme)
should be somewhat familiar, below headers of Scala code. (Theme `tower` is more accessible.) It's mostly
HTML and CSS, should be pretty tweakble.

For the ambitious, themes are defined by untemplates ending in
* `.gen.untemplate` (one template generated per site)
* `.genpost.untemplate`
(many templates generated, one per post)
* `.genpostwith.untemplate` (several templates generated, one per page of paginated posts including replies)
* `.genpostwithout.untemplate` (several templates generated, one per page of paginated posts, excluding replies)

Templates without a `.gen*.untemplate` suffix define helper functions,
used by the root, autogenerated templates.

Every untemplate defines a scala function. The helpers may be defined
to accept pretty much whatever arguments, _ad hoc_. (They each accept a
single argument, but that can be a tuple, rendering them callable with
multiple args.)

The root untemplates accept

| Root                         | Type                     |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `.gen.untemplate`            | `LocatedContext`         |
| `.getpost.untemplate`        | `LocatedPostWithContext` | 
| `.genpagewith.untemplate`    | `LocatedPageWithContext` |
| `.genpagewithout.untemplate` | `LocatedPageWithContext` |

The template-generated functions live in Scala packages, beneath `com.mchange.fossilphant.theme`.
Each theme also includes helper functions, as well as constructs written in normal Scala,
you'll find those under the [parallel Scala source packages](fossilphant/src/com/mchange/fossilphant/theme).
